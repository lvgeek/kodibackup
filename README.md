# kodibackup

lvgeek - This is a git backup of my .kodi directory on my development machine. Allows me to work on it from
home or on the road. It is for my RPI based carpc based on http://www.engineering-diy.blogspot.ro/ system. 
Many changes to work with pandora, obd, and bluetooth integration. 

Still a huge work in progress.
